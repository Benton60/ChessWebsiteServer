This is a simple chess website that lets you play my custom chess engine.

It was built using the spring framework and spring boot. I used a websocket as the connection type and it is still currently in development. 

The source code can be found at src/main/resources/static
The engine logic can be found at my chess-engine-in-java repository or at src/main/java/com/example/ChessWebsiteServer/Engine.
Everything else was just fairly basic logic stuff and not super interesting.
